        <p>The ROSE Foundation, founded in 2019 as a non-profit organization, is dedicated to eradicating cervical cancer within Malaysia.</p>
        <p>Through our community engagement programs, ROSE provides women with thorough cervical screening services. Our strategy incorporates sampling and primary HPV testing, offering cervical cancer screening events almost every day all over the country.</p>
        <p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection. HPV is incredibly common, with most sexually active individuals being exposed to it at some point in their lives. While the majority of HPV infections resolve on their own without causing any symptoms or long-term health problems, persistent infections can lead to the development of cervical cancer over time.</p>
        <p>The women in Malaysia are totaling approximately 16 million. All these women, even teenage girls, should participate in regular cervical screening events. Cervical cancer is a prevalent issue worldwide, and early detection through screenings significantly improves survival rates. In Malaysia, where cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women, routine screenings empower women with the knowledge and resources to detect and address potential health concerns early, thus potentially saving lives and reducing the burden of disease.</p>
        <p>Regular cervical cancer screening has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and related deaths by detecting precancerous changes early when they are most treatable. Screening guidelines vary by country and age group, but most recommend starting screening at age 21 and continuing at regular intervals until age 65. Vaccination against HPV is also recommended for girls and boys starting at age 9 to 12 to prevent HPV infection and reduce the risk of cervical cancer later in life.</p>
        <p>Overall, cervical cancer screening plays a crucial role in the prevention and early detection of cervical cancer, saving countless lives worldwide. Efforts to improve access to screening services, particularly in underserved communities, are essential to reducing the global burden of cervical cancer and ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to benefit from early detection and treatment.</p>
        <p>To participate in a screening, start by creating an account. View events on the calendar and confirm your attendance for specific cervical cancer screening sessions. This information is crucial for our non-governmental organization, which operates without external funding. Knowing attendee numbers helps us manage costs effectively. Additionally, our website features a forum for engaging with others, enhancing community interaction and support. Furthermore, our platform offers users the convenience of toggling between light and dark mode, providing a customizable viewing experience to suit individual preferences.</p>
